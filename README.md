This modpack isn't really meant to be published that's why i decided to publish it on github only. This pack was rather made it to play with a large group of friends on a server.
The modpack includes tons of biomes, custom terrain generation and more challenges.

# PvP overhaul

This modpack uses Better combat, combat roll that makes combat different than vanilla combat.
Enchantments have also been overhauled.

# Progression overhaul

Made changes to the progression, early to mid-game stages are now overhauled to be more difficult and time consuming to lenghten the default loop of the game.

# Teamplay

This modpack is meant for larger scale multiplayer, not singleplayer.

# Note

I don't own any of these mods in the modpack, i am not earning profit from this modpack. All of the mods can be found on modrinth, or curseforge.
