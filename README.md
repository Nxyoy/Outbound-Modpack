This modpack isn't really meant to be published, rather made it to play with a large group of friends on a server.
The modpack includes tons of biomes, custom terrain generation and more challenges.

# PvP overhaul

This modpack uses Better combat, combat roll that makes combat different than vanilla combat.
Enchantments have also been overhauled.

# Note

I don't own any of these mods in the modpack, i am not earning profit from this modpack.
